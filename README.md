Sample Data Sales Annual Sales Dashboard Using Tableau

I hope you all are doing well and working passionately towards your data visualization learning. So moving further, I would like to share with all of you yet another Sales dashboard. But this time to a larger extent, which is upto the country level. This Tableau dashboard presents the hypothetical sales of products among the different buyer segments in USA. It also presents the sales, quantity and profit with respect to the different regions and states along with the mode of shipping.

Also I have created two filter buttons and replaced them with image files for switching between dark background and light background dashboards. I have also placed a hide/show filter button at the top right corner of both the dashboards.

Following are the steps which I performed to create a Sales Dashboard like this:

1. Collect the necessary sales, buyer segment, region/state, product, and shipping data.
2. Clean and organize the data, handling duplicates, missing values, and formatting.
3. Determine the important metrics like total sales, quantity sold, profit, and shipping details.
4. Select appropriate visualizations like bar charts, line charts, maps, and tables.
5. Plan an intuitive layout for the dashboard, considering placement and formatting.
6. Use a data visualization tool to create the visualizations based on the chosen types.
7. Incorporate filters to allow users to explore specific segments, regions, or states.
8. Thoroughly test the dashboard's functionality, accuracy, and adjust as needed.
9. Publish the dashboard on a platform or share it with the intended audience securely.

Following these steps will help you create a comprehensive Sales Dashboard with sales data, buyer segments, regional and state-level information, and shipping details.

Also following are the key insights that can be derived from this dashboard:

1. Identify the most profitable buyer segment and allocate resources accordingly.
2. Identify high-performing regions and prioritize efforts for regions that require attention.
3. Identify the most profitable products and regions to guide pricing and resource allocation decisions.
4. Analyze the impact of shipping modes on sales, costs, and customer satisfaction to optimize logistics.
5. Identify seasonal patterns and trends to plan inventory and promotional campaigns effectively.
6. Compare sales, quantity, and profit across segments, regions, and shipping modes to uncover valuable insights.
7. Assess metrics like average order value, customer satisfaction, and sales growth to identify areas for improvement.

These insights help in data-driven decision-making, optimizing sales strategies, and identifying growth opportunities within a sales scenario.
